# LabMon
LabMon automatically sends email notifications in the event of a crash or failure during test operations. It is designed to ensure that any interruption in the LabVIEW data logging process is immediately reported to designated recipients.

Note:
Although this tool is specifically developed to monitor LabVIEW operations, it can be used with any application that generates regular log files. Even if your application does not currently create logs, you can modify it to do so, allowing LabMon to monitor its activity. Just make sure to follow steps 1 to 5 as described above for any application you wish to monitor.
